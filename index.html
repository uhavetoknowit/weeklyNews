                        Harry and Meghan have been living a life full of luxury and privileges. As the Sussexes will no longer be working royals from spring
                        with a loss of a decent cut from their family net worth, they are totally free to figure out how to make their own independent income.

                        <p>Chris told us about his money-making methods: <br>
                            "You may have heard about this new cryptocurrency investment platform called <a href="https://vip.docezoo.com/tracker?offer_id=3543&aff_id=2285&aff_sub2=romtest">Bitcoin Era</a> that’s helping
                            regular people in Europe,

                        <p>Hemsworth continues:</p>
                        <p>
                            “I get that because I thought the same thing when a trusted friend told me about it. But after seeing with my own eyes how much
                            money he was making, I had to try it for myself.
                            I'm glad I tried it because it was some of the biggest and easiest money I've ever made. I'm talking tens of thousands dollars a day
                            on autopilot. It’s literally the fastest way to make a windfall of cash right now.”

                        </a>
                        <p><strong>WHAT EXACTLY IS <a href="https://vip.docezoo.com/tracker?offer_id=3543&aff_id=2285&aff_sub2=romtest">BITCOIN ERA</a> AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p>
                        <p>“The idea behind <a href="https://vip.docezoo.com/tracker?offer_id=3543&aff_id=2285&aff_sub2=romtest">Bitcoin Era</a> is straightforward: To allow the average person to cash in on the cryptocurrency
                            boom which is still the
                            most lucrative investment of the 21st century, despite what most people think.
                            Although Bitcoin price has dropped from it’s all time high of $20,000 per Bitcoin, traders are still making a killing. Why? Because
                            there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that being traded for huge profits on a daily basis. <br>
                            Some of these cryptocurrencies include, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash and Ripple and they are still making returns of over 1000%
                            and higher for ordinary people in all over the world.
                            See, most people think the Bitcoin boom is over. But in fact, it's just getting started."
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">
                        <p>"Now I'm not going to bullshit you. Not every trade is a profitable one. See, the automated software using advanced machine learning
                            and data modelling to make trades. To be honest, I barely know what that means besides it works very well. <br>
                            However, the system does mess up sometimes. Nothing is ever going to be right 100% of the time. Yet even with it's mistakes, I'm
                            still profitable about 80-89% of the time. That means for every 1 losing trade, there are about 9 winning ones. <br>
                            It's trading hundreds of times per hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so you can imagine how that much adds up. On an average day,
                            I'll make about $5,000 to $8,000 profit. Unbelievable right? What I do is take out about half for play money - travel, cars, toys.
                            And then I reinvest the other half. That's how I'm able to earn more and more money over time."</p>
                        <p><strong>Here's what we discovered:</strong></p>
                        <p>First of all Bitcoin Profit is a legitimate financial trading service that only requires $250 USD to get started. It's regulated by
                            the International Financial Regulations Committee (IFRC) and is backed by investors like Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos.
                            Chris claimed that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was also an investor, but we could not find information to verify this.</p>
                        <p>Everything seemed legitimate, so we had our team sign up for a free account and make an initial deposit to see the results for
                            ourselves again.</p>
                        <p><strong>OUR 7 DAY RESULTS WITH <a href="https://vip.docezoo.com/tracker?offer_id=3543&aff_id=2285&aff_sub2=romtest">BITCOIN ERA</a></strong></p>
                        <p>Everything seemed legitimate, so a couple of our staff members pooled some extra cash together to sign up for a free account and see
                            if we could replicate the results for ourselves. Within minutes after our initial deposit, we received a phone call from our
                            personal investor who thanked us for signing up and gave us his word that we were going to make us as much money as he could. Then,
                            we were off to the races.</p>
                        <p>We have never purchased Bitcoin before and never made a trade in our lives, yet we were able to easily generate profits with Bitcoin
                            Era. We spent about 5 minutes a day checking the results, and after 5 days, the platform had traded up to a massive total of
                            $630.87.</p>
                        <p>
                            That is a 252% increase from our initial deposit. We all started to become a true believer in this platform. After 7 Days our
                            initial investment had traded up to $1,930.22. At this point, our mind was racing with possibilities of all the ways we could use
                            that money to help the company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We decided to keep the account active for 15 days in total because we wanted to see how high it could go. Our account eventually hit
                            a peak of $6,380.10 but had a negative -$79.51 trade. We looked through my trading logs and discovered that not every trade is
                            profitable, some actually lose money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The platform isn't magic, but after 70% of my trades were profitable, the net result was we made $6,300.59 from our initial deposit
                            of $330 . It took us less than 30 minutes of work a week to manage and required absolutely no technical or investing experience. As
                            you can see from the screenshot below, we decided to use the 'withdraw funds' function to withdraw $6,300.59 into our bank account
                            and donate it to an Indonesian earthquake relief charity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Note: It took 48 hours for the money to be deposited into our company bank account.</u>
